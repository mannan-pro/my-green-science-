<h3>VARIATION</h3>
<img scr="variation.jpg"alt="variation">
<P>You don't have be a brilliant scientist to see that people are different. Look at the people in photograph. Like you, they belong to one  type or spices of animals. Scientists called this species HOMO SAPIENS.
    As you can see, the people in the photograph below have lots of common. For example, they have same general body shape and have similar features. However, even there are easily recognizable as human they are lots of small difference between  them.</P>
    <p>People, like all living things, inherit their characteristics from their parents. Some of your characteristics which come from your mother and some come from your father. This is why there are the VARIATION in every species of plant and animals. These are very important and have helped homo sapiens in a particular  to evolve over millions of years into very successful species.</p>
    <p>A variation is a change or slight difference in a level, amount, or quantity. The survey found a wide variation in the prices charged for canteen food. Synonyms: variety, change, deviation, difference.
        Variation refers to the differences or deviations from the recognized norm or standard. It may be a modification in structure, form or function in an organism, deviating from other organisms of the same species or group.</p>
        <h3>ADAPTATION</h3> 
        <img scr="adaptation.jpg"alt="adaptation">  
        <p>Gradual changes in the body parts and in the behaviour of the organisms in order to adjust to their surroundings are known as adaptations. This is a gradual and continuous process, which takes place over a long period of time. Needle like leaves and fleshy stems are the examples of adaptations seen in cactus plants in order to survive in the desert.        </p>
        <h3>POLER BEAR</h3>
        <img scr="polar-bear.jpg"alt="polar-bear">
        <p>Polar bears are supremely adapted to their environment – they have a number of traits that help them cope with snow, ice, and below-freezing temperatures. They are more likely to overheat than to become hypothermic, because of the following characteristics.
            Large Size. Polar bears are the world’s largest land-based carnivore. Males can get up to 1500 lbs (almost 700 kg) – even bigger than their hulking grizzly bear cousins – and this helps them retain their body heat.</p>
            <h3>CAMEL</h3>
            <img scr="camel.jpg"alt="camel">
            <p>Unlike a lot of other mammals, most of a camel's fat is stored in its humps, which allows for better thermoregulation. It makes it easier for them to release heat from their bodies in hot weather.
                Camels rarely sweat. They are much better than us at tolerating hot weather. Their body temperature fluctuates, rising in the day with the increased environmental temperature and falling at night when it is cooler. It might seem strange that camels are furry when they can be found in extremely hot deserts, but their coats actually serve as insulation, protecting them from the heat.</p>
                <h3> GERGOR MENDOL</h3>
                <img scr="gregor-mendol.jpg"alt="gregor-mendol">
                <p>Gregor Johann MENDEL was an Austrian monk and biologist whose work on heredity became the basis of the modern theory of genetics. Mendel was born on July 22, 1822 in Heizendorf, Austria, (now known as Hyncice in Czechoslovakia). He was born Johann Mendel into a poor farming family. At that time it was difficult for poor families to obtain a good education and the young Mendel saw the only way to escape a life of poverty was to enter the monastery at Brunn in Moravis, (now Brno in Czechoslovakia). Here he was given the name Gregor. This monastery was the Augustinian Order of St Thomas, a teaching order with a reputation as a centre of learning and scientific enquery.</p>
                <p>In 1900 Mendel's work was at last recognized by three independent investigators. One of these being the Dutch botanist, Hugo De Vries. But it was still not until the early 1920s and early 1930s that the full significance of his work was recognized particularly in relation to evolutionary theory. As a result of years of research in population genetics, investigators were able to demonstrate that the Darwinian theory of evolution could be described in terms of the change in gene frequency of Mendelian pairs of characteristics in a population over successive generations.</p>
                <h3>CHOROMOSOMES & GENES</h3>
                <img scr="chromosome.jpg"alt="chromosome-and-genes">
                <p> Chromosomes are threadlike structures made of protein and a single molecule of DNA that serve to carry the genomic information from cell to cell. In plants and animals (including humans), chromosomes reside in the nucleus of cells.
                    Humans have 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes (autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY), for a total of 46. Each pair contains two chromosomes, one coming from each parent, which means that children inherit half of their chromosomes from their mother and half from their father. Chromosomes can be seen through a microscope when the nucleus dissolves during cell division.
                   Chromosomes vary in number and shape among living organisms. Most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes. Humans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes . In fact, each species of plants and animals has a set number of chromosomes. A fruit fly, for example, has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12 and a dog, 39. In humans, the twenty-third pair is the sex chromosomes, while the first 22 pairs are called autosomes. Typically, biologically female individuals have two X chromosomes (XX) while those who are biologically male have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). However, there are exceptions to these rules. Chromosomes are also different sizes. The human X chromosome is about three times larger than the human Y chromosome, containing about 900 genes, while the Y chromosome has about 55 genes. The unique structure of chromosomes keeps DNA tightly wound around spool-like proteins, called histones. Without such packaging, DNA molecules would be too long to fit inside cells! For example, if all of the DNA molecules in a single human cell were unwound from their histones and placed end-to-end, they would stretch 6 feet .</p>
                   <h3>What is SPACE...?</h3>
                   <img scr="space.jpg"alt="space">
                   <p>Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure. In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit sound between them. Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.</p>
                   <P>We often refer to our expanding universe with one simple word: space. But where does space begin and, more importantly, what is it?</p>
                    <p>Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure.

                    From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often thought to begin about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level at what is known as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary boundary at an altitude where there is no appreciable air to breathe or scatter light. Passing this altitude, blue starts to give way to black because oxygen molecules are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.</P>
